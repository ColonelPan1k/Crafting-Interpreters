# Crafting-Interpreters

This is a repo for the handbook *Crafting Interpreters* by Bob Nystrom.
I found this book a few days ago and I think it's everything I could
have asked for in a book on building interpreters/compilers.

I'm using this repo to hold all of the code for the book, along with
any notes I'll take.

The structure of this book is half in Java and half in C, so I'll make
folders for each one accordingly.

At the end of this (assuming I get through it all), I'm hoping I'll have
the skills to finally implement my own little scheme-based language.
After everything this book teaches, it should be an easy enough
capstone-type project.
